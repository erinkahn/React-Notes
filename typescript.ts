// typescript
  // a superset of JS
  // built by Microsoft in 2012
  // a programming language similar to JS but with new features and a type system
  // file type is .ts
  

// type system - shows bugs, clarifies structure, refactors code
  

// HOW IS CODE TRANSPILED ? 
  // code is transpiled into JS that checks if code has correct standards and shows errors if it doesnt
  // transpiles and outputs a JS file
  // compile with command:
    tsc


// why typescript instead of JS?
  // best for larger applications especially for run time
