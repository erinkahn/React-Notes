// React Hooks
  // - createContext - used to make a global change/function to multiple components in your app, such as the language selected, the theme (dark or light), chosen currency, user profile details
  // - useRef -  used to reference some element/object in your code
  // - useFetch -  used to get or post data from or to a database or API 
  // - useEffect - lets you perform an effect in your component (setTimeout, setInterval - both require a cleanup function inside the useEffect call)
  // - useState - used when the state/value is changing on an element or object
