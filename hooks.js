// React Hooks
  
  // createContext - used to make a global change/function to multiple components in your app, such as the language selected, the theme (dark or light), chosen currency, user profile details
  
  // useContext - used to access the user context in all components
  
  // useRef -  used to reference some element/object in your code since you can't do document.querySelector(element) in react
  
  // useFetch -  used to get or post data from or to a database or API 
  
  // useEffect - lets you perform an effect in your component after the component renders and the DOM has been updated ( examples: setTimeout, onScroll, change document.title, setInterval, fetch data, setup a subscription, change the DOM )
      
  // useState - used when the state/value is changing on an element or object
