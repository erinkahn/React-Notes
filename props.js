Props - properties used to handle data, a way to pass existing data to a React component, 
however the component cannot change the props - they're read-only, a one way data flow…
so you need state to be able to access private data and change it
Props are immutable/ can’t change inside the body of a component/function…you can only change the VALUE of a prop
- These DON’T change *** immutable
- Anytime you want to pass data into a component so that component can determine what will get displayed on the
screen.
